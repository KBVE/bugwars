description: OAuth callback handler for BugWars authentication

import AstroCallback from '@/components/auth/AstroCallback.astro';

<AstroCallback />

## What's Happening?

After you authorize BugWars with your chosen authentication provider (GitHub or Discord), you'll be redirected back here to complete the sign-in process.

This page:

1. **Receives the OAuth token** from your authentication provider
2. **Stores your session** securely in IndexedDB
3. **Initializes the SharedWorker** to manage your session across tabs
4. **Redirects you** to the home page once authentication is complete

## Troubleshooting

If you're stuck on this page:

- Make sure you completed the authorization with your provider
- Check that third-party cookies are enabled in your browser
- Try the sign-in process again from the [authentication page](/auth)

If problems persist, you can return to the [home page](/) and try signing in again.
