BugWars uses Supabase authentication to securely manage user accounts and sessions.

## Sign In

Choose your preferred authentication provider to get started:

<AstroLogin />

## Features

When you sign in, you'll be able to:

- **Save Your Progress**: Your game progress is automatically saved to your account
- **Compete on Leaderboards**: See how you rank against other players
- **Unlock Achievements**: Track your accomplishments across sessions
- **Cross-Device Play**: Access your account from any device

## Privacy & Security

Your authentication is handled securely through Supabase:

- Passwords are never stored in plain text
- OAuth providers (GitHub, Discord) follow industry-standard security practices
- Your session data is encrypted and stored locally using IndexedDB
- You can sign out at any time from the [logout page](/auth/logout)

## Need Help?

If you're experiencing issues with authentication, try:

1. Clearing your browser cache and cookies
2. Signing out completely and signing back in
3. Checking that third-party cookies are enabled for OAuth providers
