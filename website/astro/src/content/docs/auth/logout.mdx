## What's Happening?

When you sign out, we ensure your session is completely removed:

1. **Clear your session** from the authentication bridge
2. **Delete session data** from IndexedDB
3. **Remove tokens** from localStorage
4. **Redirect you** to the home page

## Your Data is Safe

Signing out removes your authentication session from this browser, but:

- Your game progress and account data remain safely stored on our servers
- You can sign back in anytime to resume playing
- Your achievements and leaderboard rankings are preserved

## Sign Back In
